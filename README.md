## Description

A tampermonkey script that adds some features to The Chairman's Bao website.

## Motivation

I was feeling very frustrated trying to find assignments I needed to do (they are in a weird horizontal scroll with no sorting options) and I thought it would be a good opportunity to learn how to make a tampermonkey script.
